I installed LaTex for my discrete mathematics homework. It turned out to be quite efficient, more so than markdown in VScode. One very useful feature is exporting as pdf, as typesetting to a pdf is exactly the way that LaTex is previewed while markdown simply uses extensions to open a preview window.
At start, I tried to use a vscode extention to write Latex. It didn't work that well because it didn't show the logs clearly and kept auto buildin with the wrong recipe. So after some research, I turned to TexShop. It was much more user-friendly.

Today I studied at the library. I was working on my discrete mathematics homework. 
It wasn't hard, but it was indeed time-consuming as I was still getting used to using Markdown to solve problems.
The homework got me so tired! After finishing it I didn't even have the energy to read the linear algebra book or even watch videos!

This has made me realize the importance of rest. It's impossible to stay focus for an extended period of time, even if you're doing things that interest you.
Our brain just doesn't work that way. Therefore, I need to get up once a while to relax my mind and muscles. Maybe stand up for some stretches or go get more water.

Recently I've been dying for tasty food. Well, mainly the dishes I have in Hangzhou. I miss them so much.

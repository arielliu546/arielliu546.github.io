Recently I'm struggling with diet. Sometimes I seem to have an unsatiable appetite, unable to stop over-eating. After a fit of chomping, I get stuffed, become upset and regretful, and usually up my mind to skip a meal or something. Then, after some hours of digesting, I get hungry again and eat loads again. I don't know if this is healthy for my body, but I'm sure it does no good to my mood. 

I read quite some books about dieting. Some suggest skipping breakfast, while some say quitting carbonhydrate. Each book seems to provide a different approach. It is said that as everyone's body is different, there's no one-for-all diet recipe. Therefore, an idea has come to me. I propose that I do an experiment on myself, trying out different diets and finding the best one for my own body. 

So let's do it.
